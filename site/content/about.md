Hello! I'am Erwin Steffens, a software developer from [Schoonebeek, The Netherlands](https://goo.gl/maps/BJwEv6LUr172).

I started developing C based software for small embedded devices for a few years. After this I started developing software for desktop, web and cloud (Azure) based on C# .NET.  

After using Vagrant and docker for a development environment on our company I got very interrested in it. I was supprised by the new opensource strategy of Microsoft and the developments in ASP.NET vNext. The new CoreCLR and docker possiblities exactly match my interrests in microservices, Docker, Devops. In my free time I spent a lot of time reading on these subjects and (for me) new programming languages (Go, Ruby, NodeJS).
