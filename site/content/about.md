Hello! I am Erwin Steffens, a software developer from [Schoonebeek, The Netherlands](https://goo.gl/maps/BJwEv6LUr172).

Currently employed at [Cross Point](http://www.crosspoint.nl) where I build C# .NET based applications for desktop, cloud (Azure) and web. 

Always interested in new technologies, programming languages and methods. I spent a lot of my free time reading about 'the new stack' based on microservices and Docker.

## Main interests
